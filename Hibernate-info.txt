Task

In one to many, one to many check varoious annotations

@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
Here it creates single table only.
table vehicle will have new column DTYPE which represents the class name.

-------------------------

Building session factory
Earlier using AnnotationConfiguration (Now its deprecated.)

In V 4.X
Configuration configuration = new Configuration().configure(HibernateUtil.class.getResource("/hibernate.cfg.xml"));
	           
				StandardServiceRegistryBuilder serviceRegistryBuilder = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder();
	            serviceRegistryBuilder.applySettings(configuration.getProperties());
	            ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry = serviceRegistryBuilder.build();
	            SessionFactory sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory(serviceRegistry);

Session
Hibernate Session is the interface between java application and hibernate framework


Saving the object

1) persist
saves the object. does not return any value. ie primary key value.

2)save
saves the object. it returns the primary key column value 

3) saveOrUpdate(obj)

To save persistent entity in another session, we can use saveOrUpdate method.
To save the detached object in a different session, we need to use this method.
We can use this method to save transient object too.

refresh
Sometimes we face situation where we application database is modified with some external application/agent and thus corresponding 
hibernate entity in your application actually becomes out of sync with itâ€™s database representation i.e. having old data. 
In this case, you can use session.refresh() method to re-populate the entity with latest data available in database. 
example:
sessionTwo.refresh(obj);
----------

merge
It updates the database with values from a detached entity.
Merging is performed when you desire to have a detached entity changed to persistent state again	

==================
Transient data, persistent data

Transient data:
We have created the object. set the data to it. Update the database row. No need to select the object from the db for updating.
session.update(Obj);
------
check session.merge(Obj);

----------------

transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL"
one more option is JTA


List<Person>persons = session.createQuery("from Person").list();


Hibernate object states
Person obj = new Person("mahesh"); //its transient object
session.save(obj); //object becomes persistent object. which has representation in the db. 	


Inheritance concepts

@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED)
public class Vehicle { vehicle_id,vehicle_name}


public class Motorcycle extends Vehicle{engineType}

Now if you save objects.
vehicle table will have motorcycle objects vehicle id, name
motorcycle table has only one column engineType


@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public class Vehicle {}

In this case motorcycle class will have 3 columns. vehicle_id, name,enginetype



=====================
Check

batch processing
<property name="hibernate.jdbc.batch_size">10</property>
session.save(obj);

--condition
session.flush();
session.clear();

hibernate.jdbc.fetch_size ???
session.flush ?

Caching in data
1st level cache
Session cache. It is enabled by default. Objects stored in the 1st level cache are accessible only in the session in which they are stored.
always 1st level cache always be considered first before any attempt to made to find object in 2nd level cache.

2nd level cache
its configurable according to per class. or per collection basis. and its mainly responsible for caching objects across sessions.

4 cache strategy available.
1) Transactional
2) Read write 
3) Non 
4) Read only 

To enable 2nd level cache you need to below jars
ehcache-core.jar
hibernate-ehcache.jar

then ehcache.xml file should be present.

In the property file you need to mention the below properties.
<property name="cache.provider_class">org.hibernate.cache.EhCacheProvider</property>  
<property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property>

Inheritance
check table per class strategy
-------
OneToMany example

MCategory.java
@OneToMany(mappedBy="category",cascade=CascadeType.ALL)		
		private Set<MProduct> products;

MProduct.java
@ManyToOne
		@JoinColumn(name="category_id")
		private MCategory category;
		

--------------------
OneToOne example
		
MCategory.java
@OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
		@JoinColumn(name="product_id")
		private MProduct products;
		
------------------------
Lazy loading

@OneToMany and @ManyToMany associations are defaulted to LAZY loading; and @OneToOne and @ManyToOne are defaulted to EAGER loading

example
MCategory.java
@OneToMany(mappedBy="category",cascade=CascadeType.ALL,fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
		private Set<MProduct> products;

============================

@Id
@Column(name="user_id")
private int id;
		
@Column(name="user_name")
private String name;

Note: we can write the annotation on top of getter methods.

=====================================
@Entity(name="user_details")  // Here entity name is user_details
public class UserDetails {


@Entity
@Table((name="user_details")  // Here table name is user_details
public class UserDetails {

Difference between two
Hibernate tutorial -05 : more annotation

========================================
@Transient
@Column(name="user_name")
private String name;

Use of @Transient
In this case, it wont write the value to the db.

=========================================

@Lob

Primary keys in hibernate

@Id
Its a primary key. 

Surrogate key
It acts as primarykey. but it doesnot have any business significance.

Natural keys
these column has business purpose and its unique. example: email id or login id

=====================

@Id
@GeneratedValue
private int id;

@GeneratedValue : If you use this one, no need to give value to this column. 
Hibernate will automatically generate the value.

==========================================

Entity type object, Value type objects


@Embedded
private Address address;
Note: this anootation is not compulsory.


@AttributeOverrides
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4432748/what-does-attributeoverride-mean

@Embedded
@AttributeOverrides({
@AttributeOverride(name="city",column=@Column(name="home_city123")),
@AttributeOverride(name="state",column=@Column(name="home_state123"))
})
private Address address;

By using the @AttributeOverride you're saying 'ignore what other information you have with regard to what column it is stored in, and use the one i specify here'.


@EmbeddedId
This annotation is used for primary key, which is generated using other class object.
=============================================
		Saving collection



=============================================
		Check
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO) and other options.
